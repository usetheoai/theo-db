# Backlog — tracked follow-ups (not yet milestones)

## IVF cosine/ip spherical k-means (from M49 review, council-index-storage HIGH-2)
The IVF k-means seeds with L2 (`ann/ivf.rs:59`) and uses arithmetic-mean centroids (`ann/ivf.rs:101`), NOT the
spherical k-means pgvector uses for cosine (`references/pgvector/src/ivfkmeans.c:33`). Arithmetic-mean centroids
drift off the unit sphere → part of the IVF cosine/ip recall gap (0.83-0.89 vs HNSW's 1.0) is centroid quality,
not purely list-probing approximation. Follow-up: spherical k-means for IVF cosine/ip (normalize for the
centroid update) OR the Design-A normalize-at-store escalation (blueprint ADR-2). Gate on a benchmark showing
the recall lift justifies the change. Not a v1.0 blocker (recall ≥ 0.80 gate met; scoring is correct).

## AVX2 kernels for IP/cosine (from M49 Phase 3)
`ip_dist_from_bytes`/`cosine_dist_from_bytes` are scalar-from-bytes (zero-alloc, the M49 DoD met). L2 has an
AVX2+FMA path. Add AVX2 to IP/cosine IF a latency benchmark shows they lag L2's kernel materially.
